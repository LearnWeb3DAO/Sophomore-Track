## Requirements

- Build an exchange with only one asset pair (Eth / Crypto Dev)
- Your Decentralized Exchange should take a fees of `1%` on swaps
- When user adds liquidity, they should be given `Crypto Dev LP` tokens (Liquidity Provider tokens)
- CD LP tokens should be given proportional to the `Ether` user is willing to add to the liquidity

Lets start building ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

- You have completed the `ICO Tutorial` from before
- You have completed the `Intro and deep dive into Decentralized Exchanges` tutorial from before
- You have completed the `Providers, Signers, ABIs, and Approval Flows` tutorial from before

### Smart Contract

To build the smart contract we would be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands

```bash
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

```bash
npx hardhat
```

Make sure you select `Create a Javascript Project` and then follow the steps in the terminal to complete your Hardhat setup.

In the same terminal now install `@openzeppelin/contracts` as we would be importing [Openzeppelin's ERC20 Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) in our `Exchange` contract

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

Create a new file inside the `contracts` directory called `Exchange.sol`. In this tutorial we would cover each part of the contract separately.

First lets start by importing `ERC20.sol` We need this because our Exchange needs to mint and create `Crypto Dev LP` tokens thats why it needs to inherit ERC20.sol

```go
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Exchange is ERC20 {
}
```

Now lets create a `constructor` for our contract

- It takes the address of the `_CryptoDevToken` that you deployed in the `ICO` tutorial as an input param
- It then checks if the address is a null address
- After all the checks, it assigns the value to the input param to the `cryptoDevTokenAddress` variable
- Constructor also sets the `name` and `symbol` for our `Crypto Dev LP` token

  ```go
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

  contract Exchange is ERC20 {

      address public cryptoDevTokenAddress;

      // Exchange is inheriting ERC20, because our exchange would keep track of Crypto Dev LP tokens
      constructor(address _CryptoDevtoken) ERC20("CryptoDev LP Token", "CDLP") {
          require(_CryptoDevtoken != address(0), "Token address passed is a null address");
          cryptoDevTokenAddress = _CryptoDevtoken;
      }
  }
  ```

Time to create a function to get reserves of the `Eth` and `Crypto Dev` tokens held
by the contract.

The ETH reserve would be equal to the balance of the contract and can be found using `address(this).balance` so lets just create a function only for getting reserves of the `Crypto Dev` tokens

We know that the `Crypto Dev Token` contract that we deployed is an ERC20. So we can just call the `balanceOf` to check the balance of `CryptoDev Tokens` that the contract holds

```go
/**
* @dev Returns the amount of `Crypto Dev Tokens` held by the contract
*/
function getReserve() public view returns (uint) {
    return ERC20(cryptoDevTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
}
```

Time to create an `addLiquidity` function which would add `liquidity` in the form of `ETH` and `Crypto Dev tokens` to our contract

If `cryptoDevTokenReserve` is zero it means that it is the first time someone is adding `Crypto Dev` tokens and `ETH` to the contract. In this case, we don't have to maintain a ratio between the tokens as we dont have any liquidity. So we accept any amount of tokens that user has sent with the initial call

If `cryptoDevTokenReserve` is not zero, then we have to make sure that when someone adds the liquidity it does not impact the price which the market currently has. To ensure this, we maintain a ratio which has to remain constant. The ratio is `(cryptoDevTokenAmount user can add/cryptoDevTokenReserve in the contract) = (Eth Sent by the user/Eth Reserve in the contract)`.

This ratio decides how much `Crypto Dev` tokens user can supply given a certain amount of ETH. When user adds liquidity, we need to provide him with some `LP` tokens because we need to keep track of the amount of liquidity he has supplied to the contract. The amount of `LP` tokens that get minted to the user are proportional to the `ETH` supplied by the user.

In the initial liquidity case, when there is no liquidity: The amount of `LP` tokens that would be minted to the user is equal to the `ETH` balance of the contract (because balance is equal to the `ETH` sent by the user in the `addLiquidity` call)

When there is already liquidity in the contract, the amount of `LP` tokens that get minted is based on a ratio. The ratio is `(LP tokens to be sent to the user (liquidity) / totalSupply of LP tokens in contract) = (Eth sent by the user) / (Eth reserve in the contract)`

> If this seems a bit confusing to you, open up the previous theory lesson again and review the mathematics behind the xy = k price function and LP tokens.

```go
/**
* @dev Adds liquidity to the exchange.
*/
function addLiquidity(uint _amount) public payable returns (uint) {
    uint liquidity;
    uint ethBalance = address(this).balance;
    uint cryptoDevTokenReserve = getReserve();
    ERC20 cryptoDevToken = ERC20(cryptoDevTokenAddress);
    /*
        If the reserve is empty, intake any user supplied value for
        `Ether` and `Crypto Dev` tokens because there is no ratio currently
    */
    if(cryptoDevTokenReserve == 0) {
        // Transfer the `cryptoDevToken` from the user's account to the contract
        cryptoDevToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        // Take the current ethBalance and mint `ethBalance` amount of LP tokens to the user.
        // `liquidity` provided is equal to `ethBalance` because this is the first time user
        // is adding `Eth` to the contract, so whatever `Eth` contract has is equal to the one supplied
        // by the user in the current `addLiquidity` call
        // `liquidity` tokens that need to be minted to the user on `addLiquidity` call should always be proportional
        // to the Eth specified by the user
        liquidity = ethBalance;
        _mint(msg.sender, liquidity);
        // _mint is ERC20.sol smart contract function to mint ERC20 tokens
    } else {
        /*
            If the reserve is not empty, intake any user supplied value for
            `Ether` and determine according to the ratio how many `Crypto Dev` tokens
            need to be supplied to prevent any large price impacts because of the additional
            liquidity
        */
        // EthReserve should be the current ethBalance subtracted by the value of ether sent by the user
        // in the current `addLiquidity` call
        uint ethReserve =  ethBalance - msg.value;
        // Ratio should always be maintained so that there are no major price impacts when adding liquidity
        // Ratio here is -> (cryptoDevTokenAmount user can add/cryptoDevTokenReserve in the contract) = (Eth Sent by the user/Eth Reserve in the contract);
        // So doing some maths, (cryptoDevTokenAmount user can add) = (Eth Sent by the user * cryptoDevTokenReserve /Eth Reserve);
        uint cryptoDevTokenAmount = (msg.value * cryptoDevTokenReserve)/(ethReserve);
        require(_amount >= cryptoDevTokenAmount, "Amount of tokens sent is less than the minimum tokens required");
        // transfer only (cryptoDevTokenAmount user can add) amount of `Crypto Dev tokens` from users account
        // to the contract
        cryptoDevToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), cryptoDevTokenAmount);
        // The amount of LP tokens that would be sent to the user should be proportional to the liquidity of
        // ether added by the user
        // Ratio here to be maintained is ->
        // (LP tokens to be sent to the user (liquidity)/ totalSupply of LP tokens in contract) = (Eth sent by the user)/(Eth reserve in the contract)
        // by some maths -> liquidity =  (totalSupply of LP tokens in contract * (Eth sent by the user))/(Eth reserve in the contract)
        liquidity = (totalSupply() * msg.value)/ ethReserve;
        _mint(msg.sender, liquidity);
    }
     return liquidity;
}
```

Now lets create a function for removing liquidity from the contract.

The amount of ether that would be sent back to the user would be based on a ratio. The ratio is `(Eth sent back to the user) / (current Eth reserve) = (amount of LP tokens that user wants to withdraw) / (total supply of LP tokens)`.

The amount of Crypto Dev tokens that would be sent back to the user would also be based on a ratio. The ratio is `(Crypto Dev sent back to the user) / (current Crypto Dev token reserve) = (amount of LP tokens that user wants to withdraw) / (total supply of LP tokens)`.

The amount of `LP` tokens that user would use to remove liquidity would be burnt

```go
/**
* @dev Returns the amount Eth/Crypto Dev tokens that would be returned to the user
* in the swap
*/
function removeLiquidity(uint _amount) public returns (uint , uint) {
    require(_amount > 0, "_amount should be greater than zero");
    uint ethReserve = address(this).balance;
    uint _totalSupply = totalSupply();
    // The amount of Eth that would be sent back to the user is based
    // on a ratio
    // Ratio is -> (Eth sent back to the user) / (current Eth reserve)
    // = (amount of LP tokens that user wants to withdraw) / (total supply of LP tokens)
    // Then by some maths -> (Eth sent back to the user)
    // = (current Eth reserve * amount of LP tokens that user wants to withdraw) / (total supply of LP tokens)
    uint ethAmount = (ethReserve * _amount)/ _totalSupply;
    // The amount of Crypto Dev token that would be sent back to the user is based
    // on a ratio
    // Ratio is -> (Crypto Dev sent back to the user) / (current Crypto Dev token reserve)
    // = (amount of LP tokens that user wants to withdraw) / (total supply of LP tokens)
    // Then by some maths -> (Crypto Dev sent back to the user)
    // = (current Crypto Dev token reserve * amount of LP tokens that user wants to withdraw) / (total supply of LP tokens)
    uint cryptoDevTokenAmount = (getReserve() * _amount)/ _totalSupply;
    // Burn the sent LP tokens from the user's wallet because they are already sent to
    // remove liquidity
    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    // Transfer `ethAmount` of Eth from the contract to the user's wallet
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(ethAmount);
    // Transfer `cryptoDevTokenAmount` of Crypto Dev tokens from the contract to the user's wallet
    ERC20(cryptoDevTokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender, cryptoDevTokenAmount);
    return (ethAmount, cryptoDevTokenAmount);
}
```

Next lets implement the swap functionality

Swap would go two ways. One way would be `Eth` to `Crypto Dev` tokens and other would be `Crypto Dev` to `Eth`

Its important for us to determine: Given `x` amount of `Eth`/`Crypto Dev` token sent by the user, how many `Eth`/`Crypto Dev` tokens would he receive from the swap?

So let's create a function which calculates this:

- We will charge `1%`. This means the amount of input tokens with fees would equal `Input amount with fees = (input amount - (1*(input amount)/100)) = ((input amount)*99)/100`
- We need to follow the concept of `XY = K` curve
- We need to make sure `(x + Î”x) * (y - Î”y) = x * y`, so the final formula is `Î”y = (y * Î”x) / (x + Î”x)`;
- `Î”y` in our case is `tokens to be received`, `Î”x = ((input amount)*99)/100`, `x` = Input Reserve, `y` = Output Reserve
- Input Reserve and Ouput Reserve would depend on which swap we are implementing. `ETH` to `Crypto Dev` token or vice versa

```go
/**
* @dev Returns the amount Eth/Crypto Dev tokens that would be returned to the user
* in the swap
*/
function getAmountOfTokens(
    uint256 inputAmount,
    uint256 inputReserve,
    uint256 outputReserve
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    require(inputReserve > 0 && outputReserve > 0, "invalid reserves");
    // We are charging a fee of `1%`
    // Input amount with fee = (input amount - (1*(input amount)/100)) = ((input amount)*99)/100
    uint256 inputAmountWithFee = inputAmount * 99;
    // Because we need to follow the concept of `XY = K` curve
    // We need to make sure (x + Î”x) * (y - Î”y) = x * y
    // So the final formula is Î”y = (y * Î”x) / (x + Î”x)
    // Î”y in our case is `tokens to be received`
    // Î”x = ((input amount)*99)/100, x = inputReserve, y = outputReserve
    // So by putting the values in the formulae you can get the numerator and denominator
    uint256 numerator = inputAmountWithFee * outputReserve;
    uint256 denominator = (inputReserve * 100) + inputAmountWithFee;
    return numerator / denominator;
}
```

Now lets implement a function to swap `ETH` for `Crypto Dev` tokens

```go
/**
* @dev Swaps Eth for CryptoDev Tokens
*/
function ethToCryptoDevToken(uint _minTokens) public payable {
    uint256 tokenReserve = getReserve();
    // call the `getAmountOfTokens` to get the amount of Crypto Dev tokens
    // that would be returned to the user after the swap
    // Notice that the `inputReserve` we are sending is equal to
    // `address(this).balance - msg.value` instead of just `address(this).balance`
    // because `address(this).balance` already contains the `msg.value` user has sent in the given call
    // so we need to subtract it to get the actual input reserve
    uint256 tokensBought = getAmountOfTokens(
        msg.value,
        address(this).balance - msg.value,
        tokenReserve
    );

    require(tokensBought >= _minTokens, "insufficient output amount");
    // Transfer the `Crypto Dev` tokens to the user
    ERC20(cryptoDevTokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender, tokensBought);
}
```

Now lets implement a function to swap `Crypto Dev` tokens to `ETH`

```go
/**
* @dev Swaps CryptoDev Tokens for Eth
*/
function cryptoDevTokenToEth(uint _tokensSold, uint _minEth) public {
    uint256 tokenReserve = getReserve();
    // call the `getAmountOfTokens` to get the amount of Eth
    // that would be returned to the user after the swap
    uint256 ethBought = getAmountOfTokens(
        _tokensSold,
        tokenReserve,
        address(this).balance
    );
    require(ethBought >= _minEth, "insufficient output amount");
    // Transfer `Crypto Dev` tokens from the user's address to the contract
    ERC20(cryptoDevTokenAddress).transferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        _tokensSold
    );
    // send the `ethBought` to the user from the contract
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(ethBought);
}
```

Your final contract should look like this:

```go
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

Let's now install the `dotenv` package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Now create a `.env` file in the `hardhat-tutorial` folder and add the following lines. Follow the instructions below.

Go to [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=learnweb3&utm_campaign=generic&utm_content=sign-up&utm_medium=learnweb3) and sign up for an account. If you already have an account, log in. Quicknode is a node provider that lets you connect to various different blockchains. We will be using it to deploy our contract through Hardhat. After creating an account, `Create an endpoint` on Quicknode, select `Ethereum`, and then select the `Goerli` network. Click `Continue` in the bottom right and then click on `Create Endpoint`. Copy the link given to you in `HTTP Provider` and add it to the `.env` file below for `QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL`.

> NOTE: If you previously set up a Goerli Endpoint on Quicknode during the Freshman Track, you can use the same URL as before. No need to delete it and set up a new one.

To get your private key, you need to export it from Metamask. Open Metamask, click on the three dots, click on `Account Details` and then `Export Private Key`. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING A TEST ACCOUNT THAT DOES NOT HAVE MAINNET FUNDS FOR THIS. Add this Private Key below in your `.env` file for `PRIVATE_KEY` variable.

```
QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL="add-quicknode-http-provider-url-here"

PRIVATE_KEY="add-the-private-key-here"
```

Lets also create a constants folder to keep track of any constants we have. Under the `hardhat-tutorial` folder create a new folder named `constants` and under the `constants` folder create a new file `index.js`

Inside the `index.js` file add the following lines of code. Remember to replace `ADDRESS-OF-CRYPTO-DEV-TOKEN` with the contract address of the `Crypto Dev` token contract that you deployed in the `ICO` tutorial

```js
const CRYPTO_DEV_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "ADDRESS-OF-CRYPTO-DEV-TOKEN";

module.exports = { CRYPTO_DEV_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS };
```

Lets deploy the contract to `goerli` network. Create a new file, or replace the existing default one, named `deploy.js` under the `scripts` folder

Now we would write some code to deploy the contract in `deploy.js` file.

```js
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });
const { CRYPTO_DEV_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS } = require("../constants");

async function main() {
  const cryptoDevTokenAddress = CRYPTO_DEV_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
  /*
  A ContractFactory in ethers.js is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts,
  so exchangeContract here is a factory for instances of our Exchange contract.
  */
  const exchangeContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("Exchange");

  // here we deploy the contract
  const deployedExchangeContract = await exchangeContract.deploy(
    cryptoDevTokenAddress
  );
  await deployedExchangeContract.deployed();

  // print the address of the deployed contract
  console.log("Exchange Contract Address:", deployedExchangeContract.address);
}

// Call the main function and catch if there is any error
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Open the `hardhat.config.js` file, we'll the `goerli` network here so that we can deploy our contract to the Goerli network. Replace all the lines in the `hardhat.config.js` file with the given below lines

```js
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

const QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL = process.env.QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL,
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

To deploy, open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

```bash
 npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

- Save the Exchange Contract Address that was printed on your terminal in your notepad, you would need it further down in the tutorial.

### Website

To develop the website we would be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework which is used to make websites and Next Js is built on top of React.

First, You would need to create a new `next` app. Your folder structure should look something like

```
   - DeFi-Exchange
       - hardhat-tutorial
       - my-app
```

To create this `my-app`, in the terminal point to DeFi-Exchange folder and type

```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest
```

and press `enter` for all the questions

Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Now go to `http://localhost:3000`, your app should be running ðŸ¤˜

Now lets install [Web3Modal library](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy-to-use library to help developers add support for multiple providers in their apps with a simple customizable configuration. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc), You can also easily configure the library to support Portis, Fortmatic, Squarelink, Torus, Authereum, D'CENT Wallet and Arkane.
Open up a terminal pointing at`my-app` directory and execute this command

```bash
  npm install web3modal
```

In the same terminal also install `ethers.js`

```bash
npm i ethers
```

In your public folder, download this [image](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Defi-Exchange/blob/main/my-app/public/cryptodev.svg) and rename it to `cryptodev.svg`.

Now go to styles folder and replace all the contents of `Home.modules.css` file with the following code, this would add some styling to your dapp:

```css
.main {
  min-height: 90vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
}

.footer {
  display: flex;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.image {
  width: 70%;
  height: 50%;
  margin-left: 20%;
}

.input {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 1%;
  margin: 2%;
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.title {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem 0;
}

.description {
  line-height: 1;
  margin: 2%;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.button {
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: purple;
  border: none;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 100px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin: 2%;
}

.inputDiv {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 1%;
  margin: 2%;
  border: lightslategray;
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
  border-radius: 10px;
}
.select {
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 175px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin: 2%;
}

.button1 {
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: blue;
  border: none;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 100px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin: 2%;
}
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  .main {
    width: 100%;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

Now lets create a constants folder to keep track of any constants we might have. Create a `constants` folder under `my-app` folder and inside the `constants` folder create a file names index.js
Paste the following code.

- Replace `ABI-CRYPTO-DEV-TOKEN-CONTRACT` with the abi of the `Crypto Dev` token contract that you deployed in the ICO tutorial.
- Replace `ADDRESS-OF-CRYPTO-DEV-TOKEN-CONTRACT` with the address of the `Crypto Dev` token contract that you deployed in the ICO tutorial
- Replace `ABI-EXCHANGE-CONTRACT` with the abi of the Exchange Contract. To get the abi for your contract, go to your `hardhat-tutorial/artifacts/contracts/Exchange.sol` folder and from your `Exchange.json` file get the array marked under the `"abi"` key.
- Replace `ADDRESS-EXCHANGE-CONTRACT` with the address of the exchange contract that you deployed above and saved to your notepad

  ```javascript
  export const TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI = "ABI-CRYPTO-DEV-TOKEN-CONTRACT";
  export const TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "ADDRESS-OF-CRYPTO-DEV-TOKEN-CONTRACT";
  export const EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI = "ABI-EXCHANGE-CONTRACT";
  export const EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "ADDRESS-EXCHANGE-CONTRACT";
  ```

Now we would create some utility files which would help us to better interact with the contract. Create a `utils` folder inside the `my-app` folder and inside the folder create 4 files: `addLiquidity.js`, `removeLiquidity.js`, `getAmounts.js`, and `swap.js`

Lets start by writing some code in `getAmounts.js`. This file is used to retrieve balances and reserves for assets

```javascript
import { Contract } from "ethers";
import {
  EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
  EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI,
  TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
} from "../constants";

/**
 * getEtherBalance: Retrieves the ether balance of the user or the contract
 */
export const getEtherBalance = async (provider, address, contract = false) => {
  try {
    // If the caller has set the `contract` boolean to true, retrieve the balance of
    // ether in the `exchange contract`, if it is set to false, retrieve the balance
    // of the user's address
    if (contract) {
      const balance = await provider.getBalance(EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
      return balance;
    } else {
      const balance = await provider.getBalance(address);
      return balance;
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return 0;
  }
};

/**
 * getCDTokensBalance: Retrieves the Crypto Dev tokens in the account
 * of the provided `address`
 */
export const getCDTokensBalance = async (provider, address) => {
  try {
    const tokenContract = new Contract(
      TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI,
      provider
    );
    const balanceOfCryptoDevTokens = await tokenContract.balanceOf(address);
    return balanceOfCryptoDevTokens;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
};

/**
 * getLPTokensBalance: Retrieves the amount of LP tokens in the account
 * of the provided `address`
 */
export const getLPTokensBalance = async (provider, address) => {
  try {
    const exchangeContract = new Contract(
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
      provider
    );
    const balanceOfLPTokens = await exchangeContract.balanceOf(address);
    return balanceOfLPTokens;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
};

/**
 * getReserveOfCDTokens: Retrieves the amount of CD tokens in the
 * exchange contract address
 */
export const getReserveOfCDTokens = async (provider) => {
  try {
    const exchangeContract = new Contract(
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
      provider
    );
    const reserve = await exchangeContract.getReserve();
    return reserve;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
};
```

Lets now write some code for `addLiquidity.js`.

- `addLiquidity.js` has two functions `addLiquidity` and `calculateCD`

  - `addLiquidity` is used to call the `addLiquidity` function in the contract to add liquidity
  - It also gets the `Crypto Dev` tokens approved for the contract by the user. The reason why `Crypto Dev` tokens need approval is because they are an ERC20 token. For the contract to withdraw an ERC20 from a user's account, it needs the approval from the user's account
  - `calculateCD` tells you for a given amount of `Eth`, how many `Crypto Dev` tokens can be added to the `liquidity`
  - We calculate this by maintaining a ratio. The ratio we follow is `(amount of Crypto Dev tokens to be added) / (Crypto Dev tokens balance) = (Eth that would be added) / (Eth reserve in the contract)`
  - So by maths we get `(amount of Crypto Dev tokens to be added) = (Eth that would be added * Crypto Dev tokens balance) / (Eth reserve in the contract)`
  - The ratio is needed so that adding liquidity doesn't largely impact the price

  - Note `tx.wait()` means we are waiting for the transaction to get mined

  ```javascript
  import { Contract, utils } from "ethers";
  import {
    EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
    EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI,
    TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  } from "../constants";

  /**
   * addLiquidity helps add liquidity to the exchange,
   * If the user is adding initial liquidity, user decides the ether and CD tokens he wants to add
   * to the exchange. If he is adding the liquidity after the initial liquidity has already been added
   * then we calculate the Crypto Dev tokens he can add, given the Eth he wants to add by keeping the ratios
   * constant
   */
  export const addLiquidity = async (
    signer,
    addCDAmountWei,
    addEtherAmountWei
  ) => {
    try {
      // create a new instance of the token contract
      const tokenContract = new Contract(
        TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI,
        signer
      );
      // create a new instance of the exchange contract
      const exchangeContract = new Contract(
        EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
        signer
      );
      // Because CD tokens are an ERC20, user would need to give the contract allowance
      // to take the required number CD tokens out of his contract
      let tx = await tokenContract.approve(
        EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        addCDAmountWei.toString()
      );
      await tx.wait();
      // After the contract has the approval, add the ether and cd tokens in the liquidity
      tx = await exchangeContract.addLiquidity(addCDAmountWei, {
        value: addEtherAmountWei,
      });
      await tx.wait();
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  };

  /**
   * calculateCD calculates the CD tokens that need to be added to the liquidity
   * given `_addEtherAmountWei` amount of ether
   */
  export const calculateCD = async (
    _addEther = "0",
    etherBalanceContract,
    cdTokenReserve
  ) => {
    // `_addEther` is a string, we need to convert it to a Bignumber before we can do our calculations
    // We do that using the `parseEther` function from `ethers.js`
    const _addEtherAmountWei = utils.parseEther(_addEther);

    // Ratio needs to be maintained when we add liquidty.
    // We need to let the user know for a specific amount of ether how many `CD` tokens
    // He can add so that the price impact is not large
    // The ratio we follow is (amount of Crypto Dev tokens to be added) / (Crypto Dev tokens balance) = (Eth that would be added) / (Eth reserve in the contract)
    // So by maths we get (amount of Crypto Dev tokens to be added) = (Eth that would be added * Crypto Dev tokens balance) / (Eth reserve in the contract)

    const cryptoDevTokenAmount = _addEtherAmountWei
      .mul(cdTokenReserve)
      .div(etherBalanceContract);
    return cryptoDevTokenAmount;
  };
  ```

Now add some code to `removeLiquidity.js`

- We have two functions here: One is `removeLiquidity` and the other is `getTokensAfterRemove`
- `removeLiquidity` calls the `removeLiquidity` function from the contract,
  to remove the amount of `LP` tokens specified by the user
- `getTokensAfterRemove` calulates the amount of `Ether` and `CD` tokens
  that would be sent back to the user after he removes a certain amount of `LP`
  tokens from the pool
- The amount of `Eth` that would be sent back to the user after he withdraws the `LP` token is calculated based on a ratio,
- Ratio is -> `(amount of Eth that would be sent back to the user / Eth reserve) = (LP tokens withdrawn) / (total supply of LP tokens)`
- By some maths we get -> `(amount of Eth that would be sent back to the user) = (Eth Reserve * LP tokens withdrawn) / (total supply of LP tokens)`
- Similarly we also maintain a ratio for the `CD` tokens, so here in our case
- Ratio is -> `(amount of CD tokens sent back to the user / CD Token reserve) = (LP tokens withdrawn) / (total supply of LP tokens)`
- Then `(amount of CD tokens sent back to the user) = (CD token reserve * LP tokens withdrawn) / (total supply of LP tokens)`

  ```javascript
  import { Contract, providers, utils, BigNumber } from "ethers";
  import {
    EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
    EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  } from "../constants";

  /**
   * removeLiquidity: Removes the `removeLPTokensWei` amount of LP tokens from
   * liquidity and also the calculated amount of `ether` and `CD` tokens
   */
  export const removeLiquidity = async (signer, removeLPTokensWei) => {
    // Create a new instance of the exchange contract
    const exchangeContract = new Contract(
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
      signer
    );
    const tx = await exchangeContract.removeLiquidity(removeLPTokensWei);
    await tx.wait();
  };

  /**
   * getTokensAfterRemove: Calculates the amount of `Eth` and `CD` tokens
   * that would be returned back to user after he removes `removeLPTokenWei` amount
   * of LP tokens from the contract
   */
  export const getTokensAfterRemove = async (
    provider,
    removeLPTokenWei,
    _ethBalance,
    cryptoDevTokenReserve
  ) => {
    try {
      // Create a new instance of the exchange contract
      const exchangeContract = new Contract(
        EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
        provider
      );
      // Get the total supply of `Crypto Dev` LP tokens
      const _totalSupply = await exchangeContract.totalSupply();
      // Here we are using the BigNumber methods of multiplication and division
      // The amount of Eth that would be sent back to the user after he withdraws the LP token
      // is calculated based on a ratio,
      // Ratio is -> (amount of Eth that would be sent back to the user / Eth reserve) = (LP tokens withdrawn) / (total supply of LP tokens)
      // By some maths we get -> (amount of Eth that would be sent back to the user) = (Eth Reserve * LP tokens withdrawn) / (total supply of LP tokens)
      // Similarly we also maintain a ratio for the `CD` tokens, so here in our case
      // Ratio is -> (amount of CD tokens sent back to the user / CD Token reserve) = (LP tokens withdrawn) / (total supply of LP tokens)
      // Then (amount of CD tokens sent back to the user) = (CD token reserve * LP tokens withdrawn) / (total supply of LP tokens)
      const _removeEther = _ethBalance.mul(removeLPTokenWei).div(_totalSupply);
      const _removeCD = cryptoDevTokenReserve
        .mul(removeLPTokenWei)
        .div(_totalSupply);
      return {
        _removeEther,
        _removeCD,
      };
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  };
  ```

Now it's time to write code for `swap.js` our last `utils` file

- It has two functions `getAmountOfTokenReceivedFromSwap` and `swapTokens`
- `swapTokens` swaps certain amount of `Eth/Crypto Dev` tokens with `Crypto Dev/Eth` tokens
- If `Eth` has been selected by the user from the UI, it means that the user has `Eth` and he wants to swap it for a certain amount of `Crypto Dev` tokens
- In this case we call the `ethToCryptoDevToken` function. Note that `Eth` is sent as a value in the function because the user is paying this `Eth` to the contract. `Eth` sent is not an input param value in this case
- On the other hand, if `Eth` is not selected this means that the user wants to swap `Crypto Dev` tokens for `Eth`
- Here we call the `cryptoDevTokenToEth`
- `getAmountOfTokensReceivedFromSwap` is a function which calculates, given a certain amount of `Eth/Crypto Dev` tokens, how many `Eth/Crypto Dev` tokens would be sent back to the user
- If `Eth` is selected it calls the `getAmountOfTokens` from the contract which takes in an `input` reserve and an `output` reserve. Here, input reserve would be the `Eth` balance of the contract and output reserve would be the `Crypto Dev` token reserve. Opposite would be true, if `Eth` is not selected

  ```javascript
  import { Contract } from "ethers";
  import {
    EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
    EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI,
    TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  } from "../constants";

  /*
      getAmountOfTokensReceivedFromSwap:  Returns the number of Eth/Crypto Dev tokens that can be received 
      when the user swaps `_swapAmountWei` amount of Eth/Crypto Dev tokens.
  */
  export const getAmountOfTokensReceivedFromSwap = async (
    _swapAmountWei,
    provider,
    ethSelected,
    ethBalance,
    reservedCD
  ) => {
    // Create a new instance of the exchange contract
    const exchangeContract = new Contract(
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
      provider
    );
    let amountOfTokens;
    // If `Eth` is selected this means our input value is `Eth` which means our input amount would be
    // `_swapAmountWei`, the input reserve would be the `ethBalance` of the contract and output reserve
    // would be the `Crypto Dev` token reserve
    if (ethSelected) {
      amountOfTokens = await exchangeContract.getAmountOfTokens(
        _swapAmountWei,
        ethBalance,
        reservedCD
      );
    } else {
      // If `Eth` is not selected this means our input value is `Crypto Dev` tokens which means our input amount would be
      // `_swapAmountWei`, the input reserve would be the `Crypto Dev` token reserve of the contract and output reserve
      // would be the `ethBalance`
      amountOfTokens = await exchangeContract.getAmountOfTokens(
        _swapAmountWei,
        reservedCD,
        ethBalance
      );
    }

    return amountOfTokens;
  };

  /*
    swapTokens: Swaps `swapAmountWei` of Eth/Crypto Dev tokens with `tokenToBeReceivedAfterSwap` amount of Eth/Crypto Dev tokens.
  */
  export const swapTokens = async (
    signer,
    swapAmountWei,
    tokenToBeReceivedAfterSwap,
    ethSelected
  ) => {
    // Create a new instance of the exchange contract
    const exchangeContract = new Contract(
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ABI,
      signer
    );
    const tokenContract = new Contract(
      TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI,
      signer
    );
    let tx;
    // If Eth is selected call the `ethToCryptoDevToken` function else
    // call the `cryptoDevTokenToEth` function from the contract
    // As you can see you need to pass the `swapAmount` as a value to the function because
    // it is the ether we are paying to the contract, instead of a value we are passing to the function
    if (ethSelected) {
      tx = await exchangeContract.ethToCryptoDevToken(
        tokenToBeReceivedAfterSwap,
        {
          value: swapAmountWei,
        }
      );
    } else {
      // User has to approve `swapAmountWei` for the contract because `Crypto Dev` token
      // is an ERC20
      tx = await tokenContract.approve(
        EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        swapAmountWei.toString()
      );
      await tx.wait();
      // call cryptoDevTokenToEth function which would take in `swapAmountWei` of `Crypto Dev` tokens and would
      // send back `tokenToBeReceivedAfterSwap` amount of `Eth` to the user
      tx = await exchangeContract.cryptoDevTokenToEth(
        swapAmountWei,
        tokenToBeReceivedAfterSwap
      );
    }
    await tx.wait();
  };
  ```

Now its time for the final stages of our app, lets add some code to the `pages/index.js` file which next already gives you. Replace all the contents of the file with the following content
