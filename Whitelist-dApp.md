# Build a whitelist dApp for your upcoming NFT Collection

You are launching your NFT collection named `Crypto Devs`. You want to give your early supporters access to a whitelist for your collection, so here you are creating a whitelist dapp for `Crypto Devs`

![](https://i.imgur.com/zgY0TGo.png)

## Requirements

- Whitelist access should be given to the first `10` users for free who want to get in.
- There should be a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Following the previous topics, we assume that you have already **created a new wallet for development purposes only with no live funds**. It is essential to only connect to your newly created development Metamask (or any other product you use) wallet when practicing or testing deployments. **Accidential usage of live wallets can result real ETH usage and an unwanted financial cost.**

Let's start building 🚀

---

## Prerequisites

- You can write code in JavaScript (Freshman Track - Introduction to Programming)
- Have set up a Metamask Wallet (Freshman Track - Setting up a crypto wallet)
- Your computer has Node.js installed. If not download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Build

### Smart Contract

To build the smart contract we will be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

First, you need to create a Whitelist-Dapp folder where the Hardhat project and your Next.js app will later go. Open up a terminal and execute these commands

```bash
mkdir Whitelist-Dapp
cd Whitelist-Dapp
```

Then, in Whitelist-Dapp folder, we will set up a Hardhat project

> Note : We install Hardhat v2.14.0 specifically since the new v2.15.0 will install new hardhat-toolbox v3 that has breaking changes to the code.

```bash
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev --save-exact hardhat@2.14.0
```
If you are a Windows User, you'll have to add one more dependency. It is given below:

> Note : We install v2 specifically since the new v3 has breaking changes to the code.

```bash 
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@2
```

In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

```bash
npx hardhat
```

Make sure you select `Create a Javascript Project` and then follow the steps in the terminal to complete your Hardhat setup.

Once your project is set up, start by creating a new file inside the `contracts` directory called `Whitelist.sol`.

```go
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;


contract Whitelist {

    // Max number of whitelisted addresses allowed
    uint8 public maxWhitelistedAddresses;

    // Create a mapping of whitelistedAddresses
    // if an address is whitelisted, we would set it to true, it is false by default for all other addresses.
    mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedAddresses;

    // numAddressesWhitelisted would be used to keep track of how many addresses have been whitelisted
    // NOTE: Don't change this variable name, as it will be part of verification
    uint8 public numAddressesWhitelisted;

    // Setting the Max number of whitelisted addresses
    // User will put the value at the time of deployment
    constructor(uint8 _maxWhitelistedAddresses) {
        maxWhitelistedAddresses =  _maxWhitelistedAddresses;
    }

    /**
        addAddressToWhitelist - This function adds the address of the sender to the
        whitelist
     */
    function addAddressToWhitelist() public {
        // check if the user has already been whitelisted
        require(!whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender], "Sender has already been whitelisted");
        // check if the numAddressesWhitelisted < maxWhitelistedAddresses, if not then throw an error.
        require(numAddressesWhitelisted < maxWhitelistedAddresses, "More addresses cant be added, limit reached");
        // Add the address which called the function to the whitelistedAddress array
        whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender] = true;
        // Increase the number of whitelisted addresses
        numAddressesWhitelisted += 1;
    }

}
```

We will deploy the contract to the `goerli` network. Create a new file, or replace the default file named `deploy.js` under the `scripts` folder. Now we will write some code to deploy the contract in `deploy.js` file.

```js
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  /*
  DeployContract in ethers.js is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts,
  so whitelistContract here is a factory for instances of our Whitelist contract.
  */
  // here we deploy the contract
const whitelistContract = await hre.ethers.deployContract("Whitelist", [10]);
// 10 is the Maximum number of whitelisted addresses allowed

// wait for the contract to deploy
await whitelistContract.waitForDeployment();

// print the address of the deployed contract
console.log("Whitelist Contract Address:", whitelistContract.target);
}

// Call the main function and catch if there is any error
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Now create a `.env` file in the `hardhat-tutorial` folder and add the following lines. Follow the instructions below.

Go to [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=learnweb3&utm_campaign=generic&utm_content=sign-up&utm_medium=learnweb3) and sign up for an account. If you already have an account, log in. Quicknode is a node provider that lets you connect to various different blockchains. We will be using it to deploy our contract through Hardhat. After creating an account, `Create an endpoint` on Quicknode, select `Ethereum`, and then select the `Goerli` network. Click `Continue` in the bottom right and then click on `Create Endpoint`. Copy the link given to you in `HTTP Provider` and add it to the `.env` file below for `QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL`.

> NOTE: If you previously set up a Goerli Endpoint on Quicknode during the Freshman Track, you can use the same URL as before. No need to delete it and set up a new one.

To get your private key, you need to export it from Metamask. Open Metamask, click on the three dots, click on `Account Details` and then `Export Private Key`. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING A TEST ACCOUNT THAT DOES NOT HAVE MAINNET FUNDS FOR THIS. Add this Private Key below in your `.env` file for `PRIVATE_KEY` variable.

```
QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL="add-quicknode-http-provider-url-here"

PRIVATE_KEY="add-the-private-key-here"
```

Now we will install `dotenv` package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Now open the hardhat.config.js file, we would add the `goerli` network here so that we can deploy our contract to the Goerli network. Replace all the lines in the `hardhat.config.js` file with the given below lines

```js
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

const QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL = process.env.QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.9",
  networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL,
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

To deploy, open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

Save the Whitelist Contract Address that was printed on your terminal in your notepad, you would need it further down in the tutorial.

### Website

To develop the website we will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework used to make websites and Next.js is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend, so you don't need two separate frontend and backend services.

First, You will need to create a new `next` app. To create this `next-app`, in the terminal point to Whitelist-Dapp folder and type

> Note : We install v12 specifically since the new v13 has breaking changes to the code.

```bash
npx create-next-app@12
```

and press `enter` for all the questions. Choose `Javascript` instead of `Typescript` when asked.

Your folder structure should look something like

```
- Whitelist-Dapp
    - hardhat-tutorial
    - my-app
```

Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Now go to `http://localhost:3000`, your app should be running 🤘

Now lets install [Web3Modal library](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy to use library to help developers easily allow their users to connect to your dApps with all sorts of different wallets. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc) and WalletConnect, You can also easily configure the library to support Portis, Fortmatic, Squarelink, Torus, Authereum, D'CENT Wallet and Arkane.
(Here's a live example on [Codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/j43b10))

Open up a terminal pointing at `my-app` directory and execute this command

```bash
npm install web3modal
```

In the same terminal also install `ethers.js`

> Note : We install v5 specifically since the new v6 has breaking changes to the code.

```bash
npm install ethers@5
```

In your my-app/public folder, download [this image](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Whitelist-Dapp/blob/main/my-app/public/crypto-devs.svg) and rename it to `crypto-devs.svg`
Now go to your `styles` folder and replace all the contents of `Home.modules.css` file with the following code, this would add some styling to your dapp:

```css
.main {
  min-height: 90vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
}

.footer {
  display: flex;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.image {
  width: 70%;
  height: 50%;
  margin-left: 20%;
}

.title {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem 0;
}

.description {
  line-height: 1;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.button {
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: blue;
  border: none;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-bottom: 2%;
}
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  .main {
    width: 100%;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

Open your index.js file under the pages folder and paste the following code, explanation of the code can be found in the comments. Make sure you read about React and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html), [React Hooks Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_hooks.asp) if you are not familiar with them.

}
```

Now create a new folder under the my-app folder and name it `constants`. In the `constants` folder create a file, `index.js` and paste the following code.

```js
export const WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR_WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
export const abi = YOUR_ABI;
```

Replace `"YOUR_WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"` with the address of the whitelist contract that you deployed. Replace `"YOUR_ABI"` with the ABI of your Whitelist Contract. To get the ABI for your contract, go to your `hardhat-tutorial/artifacts/contracts/Whitelist.sol` folder and from your `Whitelist.json` file get the array marked under the `"abi"` key (it will be a huge array of about 100 lines or more).

Now in your terminal which is pointing to `my-app` folder, execute

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your whitelist dapp should now work without errors 🚀

### Push to github

Make sure before proceeding you have [pushed all your code to github](https://medium.com/hackernoon/a-gentle-introduction-to-git-and-github-the-eli5-way-43f0aa64f2e4) :)
