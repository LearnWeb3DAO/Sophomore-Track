# Launch your own Initial Coin Offering

Now it's time for you to launch a token for `Crypto Devs`. Let's call the token Crypto Dev Token. We'll give this token out for free to all our NFT holders, and let other people buy them for ETH.

Note: The video tutorial is based on Rinkeby testnet, but the text tutorial is based on Goerli for future support. Please use the Goerli network.

## Build

## Requirements

- There should be a max of `10,000 CD` tokens.
- Every `Crypto Dev` NFT holder should get 10 tokens for free but they would have to pay the gas fees.
- The price of one CD at the time of ICO should be `0.001 ether`.
- There should be a website that users can visit for the ICO.

Let's start building ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

- You must have completed the `NFT Collection` tutorial from earlier.

## Theory

- What is an ERC20?
  - ERC-20 is a technical standard; it is used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation and provides a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow.
  - Please look at all the ERC20 [functions](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20) before moving ahead.

## Build

### Smart Contract

To build the smart contract we will be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contracts, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

To setup a Hardhat project, open up a terminal and execute these commands:

```bash
mkdir ICO
cd ICO
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
If you are a Windows user, you'll have to add one more dependency. so in the terminal, add the following command :

```bash 
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

```bash
npx hardhat
```

Make sure you select `Create a Javascript Project` and then follow the steps in the terminal to complete your Hardhat setup.

In the same terminal, install `@openzeppelin/contracts` as we will be importing [Openzeppelin's ERC20 Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) and [Openzeppelin's Ownable Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol) in our `CryptoDevToken` contract.

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

We need to call the `CryptoDevs Contract` that you deployed for the previous level to check for owners of CryptoDev NFT's. As we only need to call `tokenOfOwnerByIndex` and `balanceOf` methods, we can create an interface for `CryptoDevs contract` with only these two functions. This way we save `gas` as we do not need to inherit and deploy the entire `CryptoDevs Contract`, but only a part of it.

Create a new file inside the `contracts` directory and call it `ICryptoDevs.sol`. Add the following lines:

```go
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ICryptoDevs {
    /**
     * @dev Returns a token ID owned by `owner` at a given `index` of its token list.
     * Use along with {balanceOf} to enumerate all of ``owner``'s tokens.
     */
    function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256 tokenId);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the number of tokens in ``owner``'s account.
     */
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
}

```

Create another file inside the `contracts` directory and call it `CryptoDevToken.sol`. Add the following lines:

```go
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
  import "./ICryptoDevs.sol";

  contract CryptoDevToken is ERC20, Ownable {
      // Price of one Crypto Dev token
      uint256 public constant tokenPrice = 0.001 ether;
      // Each NFT would give the user 10 tokens
      // It needs to be represented as 10 * (10 ** 18) as ERC20 tokens are represented by the smallest denomination possible for the token
      // By default, ERC20 tokens have the smallest denomination of 10^(-18). This means, having a balance of (1)
      // is actually equal to (10 ^ -18) tokens.
      // Owning 1 full token is equivalent to owning (10^18) tokens when you account for the decimal places.
      // More information on this can be found in the Freshman Track Cryptocurrency tutorial.
      uint256 public constant tokensPerNFT = 10 * 10**18;
      // the max total supply is 10000 for Crypto Dev Tokens
      uint256 public constant maxTotalSupply = 10000 * 10**18;
      // CryptoDevsNFT contract instance
      ICryptoDevs CryptoDevsNFT;
      // Mapping to keep track of which tokenIds have been claimed
      mapping(uint256 => bool) public tokenIdsClaimed;

      constructor(address _cryptoDevsContract) ERC20("Crypto Dev Token", "CD") {
          CryptoDevsNFT = ICryptoDevs(_cryptoDevsContract);
      }

      /**
       * @dev Mints `amount` number of CryptoDevTokens
       * Requirements:
       * - `msg.value` should be equal or greater than the tokenPrice * amount
       */
      function mint(uint256 amount) public payable {
          // the value of ether that should be equal or greater than tokenPrice * amount;
          uint256 _requiredAmount = tokenPrice * amount;
          require(msg.value >= _requiredAmount, "Ether sent is incorrect");
          // total tokens + amount <= 10000, otherwise revert the transaction
          uint256 amountWithDecimals = amount * 10**18;
          require(
              (totalSupply() + amountWithDecimals) <= maxTotalSupply,
              "Exceeds the max total supply available."
          );
          // call the internal function from Openzeppelin's ERC20 contract
          _mint(msg.sender, amountWithDecimals);
      }

      /**

       */
      function claim() public {
          address sender = msg.sender;
          // Get the number of CryptoDev NFT's held by a given sender address
          uint256 balance = CryptoDevsNFT.balanceOf(sender);
          // If the balance is zero, revert the transaction
          require(balance > 0, "You don't own any Crypto Dev NFT");
          // amount keeps track of number of unclaimed tokenIds
          uint256 amount = 0;
          // loop over the balance and get the token ID owned by `sender` at a given `index` of its token list.
          for (uint256 i = 0; i < balance; i++) {
              uint256 tokenId = CryptoDevsNFT.tokenOfOwnerByIndex(sender, i);
              // if the tokenId has not been claimed, increase the amount
              if (!tokenIdsClaimed[tokenId]) {
                  amount += 1;
                  tokenIdsClaimed[tokenId] = true;
              }
          }
          // If all the token Ids have been claimed, revert the transaction;
          require(amount > 0, "You have already claimed all the tokens");
          // call the internal function from Openzeppelin's ERC20 contract
          // Mint (amount * 10) tokens for each NFT
          _mint(msg.sender, amount * tokensPerNFT);
      }

      /**
        * @dev withdraws all ETH sent to this contract
        * Requirements:
        * wallet connected must be owner's address
        */
      function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
        uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
        require(amount > 0, "Nothing to withdraw, contract balance empty");
        
        address _owner = owner();
        (bool sent, ) = _owner.call{value: amount}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
      }

      // Function to receive Ether. msg.data must be empty
      receive() external payable {}

      // Fallback function is called when msg.data is not empty
      fallback() external payable {}
  }

```

Now we will install the `dotenv` package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing to the `hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Now create a `.env` file in the `hardhat-tutorial` folder and add the following lines. Follow the instructions below.

Go to [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=learnweb3&utm_campaign=generic&utm_content=sign-up&utm_medium=learnweb3) and sign up for an account. If you already have an account, log in. Quicknode is a node provider that lets you connect to various different blockchains. We will be using it to deploy our contract through Hardhat. After creating an account, `Create an endpoint` on Quicknode, select `Ethereum`, and then select the `Goerli` network. Click `Continue` in the bottom right and then click on `Create Endpoint`. Copy the link given to you in `HTTP Provider` and add it to the `.env` file below for `QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL`.

> NOTE: If you previously set up a Goerli Endpoint on Quicknode during the Freshman Track, you can use the same URL as before. No need to delete it and set up a new one.

To get your private key, you need to export it from Metamask. Open Metamask, click on the three dots, click on `Account Details` and then `Export Private Key`. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING A TEST ACCOUNT THAT DOES NOT HAVE MAINNET FUNDS FOR THIS. Add this Private Key below in your `.env` file for `PRIVATE_KEY` variable.

```
QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL="add-quicknode-http-provider-url-here"

PRIVATE_KEY="add-the-private-key-here"
```

Let's deploy the contract to the `goerli` network. Create a new file (or replace the existing default file) named `deploy.js` under the `scripts` folder.

Now we will write some code to deploy the contract in `deploy.js` file.

```js
const hre = require("hardhat");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });
const { CRYPTO_DEVS_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS } = require("../constants");

async function main() {
  // Address of the Crypto Devs NFT contract that you deployed in the previous module
  const cryptoDevsNFTContract = CRYPTO_DEVS_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;

  /*
    DeployContract in ethers.js is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts,
    so cryptoDevsTokenContract here is a factory for instances of our CryptoDevToken contract.
    */
 // here we deploy the contract
const cryptoDevsTokenContract = await hre.ethers.deployContract(
  "CryptoDevToken",
  [cryptoDevsNFTContract]
);

// wait for the contract to deploy
await cryptoDevsTokenContract.waitForDeployment();

// print the address of the deployed contract
console.log(
  "Crypto Devs Token Contract Address:",
  cryptoDevsTokenContract.target
);
}

// Call the main function and catch if there is any error
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

You can see that the `deploy.js` file requires a constant. Let's create a `constants` folder under `hardhat-tutorial` folder.
Inside the `constants` folder create a new file named `index.js` and add the following lines to it.

Replace "address-of-the-nft-contract" with the address of the `CryptoDevs.sol` that you deployed in the previous module(`NFT-Collection`):

```js
// Address of the NFT Contract that you deployed
const CRYPTO_DEVS_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "address-of-the-nft-contract";

module.exports = { CRYPTO_DEVS_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS };
```

Now open the `hardhat.config.js` file, we'll use the `goerli` network here so that we can deploy our contract to the Goerli network. Replace all the lines in the `hardhat.config.js` file with the given below lines

```js
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

const QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL = process.env.QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL,
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing to the `hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command:

```bash
   npx hardhat compile
```

Execute this command in the same directory to deploy the contract:

```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

Save the CryptoDevToken Contract Address that was printed to your terminal in your notepad. You will need it later in the tutorial.

### Website

To develop the website we will be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework which is used to make websites and Next Js is built on top of React.
You first need to create a new `next` app. Your folder structure should look something like this:

```
   - ICO
       - hardhat-tutorial
       - my-app
```

To create this `my-app`, in the terminal point to the `ICO` folder and type:

```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest
```

and press `enter` for all the questions.

Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal:

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Now go to `http://localhost:3000`, your app should be running ðŸ¤˜

Now let's install the [Web3Modal library](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy-to-use library to help developers add support for multiple providers in their apps with a simple customizable configuration. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc). You can also easily configure the library to support Portis, Fortmatic, Squarelink, Torus, Authereum, D'CENT Wallet, and Arkane.
Open up a terminal pointing to `my-app` directory and execute this command:

```bash
  npm install web3modal
```

In the same terminal also install `ethers.js`

> Note : We install v5 specifically since the new v6 has breaking changes to the code.

```bash
npm i ethers@5
```

In the `public` folder, download the following [image](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/NFT-Collection/tree/main/my-app/public/cryptodevs/0.svg). Make sure that the name of the downloaded image is `0.svg`.

Now go to styles folder and replace all the contents of `Home.modules.css` file with the following code. This will add some styling to your dapp:

```css
.main {
  min-height: 90vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
}

.footer {
  display: flex;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.image {
  width: 70%;
  height: 50%;
  margin-left: 20%;
}

.input {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 1%;
  margin-bottom: 2%;
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.title {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem 0;
}

.description {
  line-height: 1;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.button {
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: blue;
  border: none;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 100px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-bottom: 2%;
}
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  .main {
    width: 100%;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

Open the `index.js` file under the `pages` folder and paste the following code. An explanation of the code can be found in the comments.

```

Now create a new folder under the `my-app` folder and name it `constants`. In the `constants` folder create a file called `index.js` and paste the following code:

```js
export const NFT_CONTRACT_ABI = "abi-of-your-nft-contract";
export const NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "address-of-your-nft-contract";
export const TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI = "abi-of-your-token-contract";
export const TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "address-of-your-token-contract";
```

- Replace `"abi-of-your-nft-contract"` with the abi of the NFT contract that you deployed in the last tutorial.
- Replace `"address-of-your-nft-contract"` with the address of the NFT contract that you deployed in your previous tutorial.
- Replace `"abi-of-your-token-contract"` by the abi of the token contract. To get the abi of the Token contract, go to `hardhat-tutorial/artifacts/contracts/CryptoDevToken.sol` and then from`CryptoDevToken.json` file get the array marked under the `"abi"` key.
- Replace `"address-of-your-token-contract"` with the address of the token contract that you saved to your notepad earlier in the tutorial.

Now in your terminal which is pointing to `my-app` folder, execute the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your ICO dapp should now work without errors ðŸš€
